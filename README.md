⚠️ **This project is not complete yet**: 

- Filters are not implemented yet 
- ADSR envelopes are still in early stages.
- The documentation does not cover all the code yet.

Anyway, the VCOs are working and they respond to MIDI. The java synth is working.

# Audience

Those workshops are made for Java developers knowing zero about MIDI and Audio.

We are targeting Windows OS but things should works on OSX in the same way.
