# A hardware device always use various mode to operate. They respond differently on MIDI Channels
# - Typically a "single voice mode" is used to play a single patch at a time. The Midi Channel 0 is only used in this case
# - Whereas a "performance mode" is used to play multiple patch at a time, on the same MIDI channel. Typically, in a split mode or Layer mode.
# - "Multi mode" is often used to play many patches, one on each MIDI channel
#
# Banks belongs to modes and Patches belongs to banks
